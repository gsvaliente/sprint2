## MySQL

- 2.1 Level 1: Create a database using MySQL for an 'optica'. The database should be able to answer a few basic queries. I was able to resolve the majority without much trouble. It is complete, pending review. ✅
- 2.1 Level 1 : Create a database using MySQL for a restaurant. Created the database and queries work accordingly, pending review. ✅

- 2.2 : Queries. Most of the queries are done, but I am having trouble with the joining and finding the 'null' values. ⛔️

## MongoDB

- 2.3 Level 1 : Create the same database as the optic, but with MongoDB. I was able to figure it out, but after completing thought of another way to do it. Might be changed. 😑

- 2.3 Level 1 : Same as 2.1, pizza database. Yet to be completed. ⛔️

- 2.4 : Queries. Completed almost all of the queries using mongo. Pending review. ✅
